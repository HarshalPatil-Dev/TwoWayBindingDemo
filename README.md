Sample of Two Way Data Binding 


<H2>When do we use Two Way Data Binding ?</H2>
we can use one way data binding to show the user some data (app to user data flow).

We can also use one way data binding to get user input(user to app data flow) .

If, for some reason, we want to both show data and get user input over the same widget,

in other words, if we need a two-way data flow, we should use two-way data binding .
